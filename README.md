# portfolio-website-2023

This is the second version of my portfolio website.
(Here you can find version one: https://github.com/derermisch/portfolio-website)
Its main features are dark/light mode and language toggle which changes the contents of the website dynamically.
Otherwise, though not perfect, the code and css is better structured and abstracted compared to the first version.
